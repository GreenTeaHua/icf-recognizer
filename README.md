icf-recognizer
==============
An implementation of Integral Channel Features in Python using OpenCV.

You may access to the concerned publication [here](http://vision.ucsd.edu/sites/default/files/dollarBMVC09ChnFtrs_0.pdf).

Another publication which was tremendously helpful in understanding the used technique and its concerned application
in this repository may be accessed from [here](http://www.markusmathias.de/publications/2013_ijcnn_traffic_signs.pdf)

NOTE: I am going to re-implement this soon, since there seems to be an interest.
